# the prefix speak a private protocol over loopback, and fetching them
# separately is how they end up being different builds of it.

# Env overrides: GAME_LIBS (passed through to bleshim/build.sh, which checks the
# shim's surface against the game's own metadata -- worth setting, since a
# missing member is a MissingMethodException in the middle of a ride).
