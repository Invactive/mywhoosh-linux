# ------------------------------------------------------------ the Flatpak case
# Lutris is very often a Flatpak, and its sandbox is no place to reach Bluetooth
# from: the Flathub manifest grants no --socket=system-bus and no
# --system-talk-name=org.bluez, so BlueZ is not merely unauthorised, it is
# absent.  Two other things it does grant make this a detour rather than a wall:
#
#   --talk-name=org.freedesktop.Flatpak  so flatpak-spawn can run the helper on
#                                        the host, with the host's python3 and
#                                        the host's system bus
#   --share=network                      so the host's loopback is the same
#                                        loopback the shim inside Wine dials
#
# Everything that wants Linux rather than the sandbox therefore goes through
# $HOST.  Outside a Flatpak both are empty and the commands run as written.
