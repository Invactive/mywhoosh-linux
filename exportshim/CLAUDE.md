# exportshim — engineering notes

`README.md` is the orientation. This is the reasoning behind it.

## Why the runtime cannot be talked into doing it

The refusal comes from mono's own array marshaller,
`mono/metadata/marshal-ilgen.c`, `emit_marshal_array_ilgen`:

```c
case MARSHAL_ACTION_MANAGED_CONV_IN: {
        if (t->byref) {
                char *msg = g_strdup ("Byref array marshalling to managed code is not implemented.");
                mono_mb_emit_exception_marshal_directive (mb, msg);
```

Three consequences, from reading it rather than guessing:

- **It is native runtime code, not a managed BCL gap**, so no Cecil-style
  rewrite of an assembly reaches it. Confirmed in the prefix: the string is in
  `mono-2.0/bin/libmono-2.0-x86_64.dll` and in no managed assembly anywhere.
  Newer runtimes do not help — wine-mono 10.0.0 and 11.1.0 both carry it.
- **The refusal is compiled into the wrapper**, which is why probes that call
  the managed methods directly never see it: the native-to-managed wrapper
  builds fine and throws on the first call, from a frame where nothing can
  catch it.
- **Deleting the byref check would not be enough.** Two more walls stand behind
  it in the same function: the array needs a `[MarshalAs]` to fix a native
  shape, then a `SizeConst` or `SizeParamIndex` to know how many elements to
  read. The game's metadata has neither — measured with `../tools/SigDump.exe`,
  the parameter carries `[Out]` and nothing else. Supporting it would mean
  writing the out-direction inside `libmono` and shipping a self-built
  wine-mono.

## The float returns, and heart rate

The twelve `float`-returning exports (`BT_GetHeart`, `BT_GetPower`, …) marshal
fine; the engine reads the wrong register. Measured in the prefix with a
mingw-built native caller against the game's own DLL: `WD_GetHeart` returned
`-1.0` in `xmm0` and `0xc5f000` in `rax`. The HUD showed exactly that kind of
value — a heap address, different every run — while the probe calling the
same export got the right BPM. On Windows the CLR's `cvtsi2ss xmm0, eax`
leaves the `int` in `rax`, so a caller that reads `rax` gets the right answer
by accident; mono's wrapper runs more code after it and does not.

Mirroring the value into `eax` is harmless to a caller that reads `xmm0`, so
it is applied to every float or double export rather than only the ones known
to be misread.

Two things about the stub that are not obvious:

- **The slot is not stable before the first call.** It starts as mono's
  compile-on-demand trampoline, which overwrites the slot with the compiled
  wrapper when first called. A stub that simply captured the old value and
  called it was replaced on its first call — the first version of this fix did
  nothing for that reason. The stub calls through a cell of its own and, after
  each call, moves whatever mono put in the slot into the cell and takes the
  slot back. The device-list hooks never call the trampoline, so they do not
  need this.
- **It registers unwind info** (`RtlAddFunctionTable`) so that a stack walk
  through the stub, from a debugger, a crash handler or mono itself, does not
  stop there.

Ruled out on the way, from the IL: `SensorBase.GetHeart` clamps to 300, so the
value never came from the decoding path; `ConnectedDevicesData.heartRate` is
only ever written as 0; and `BT_UpdateSlots` delivers the heart-rate slot
correctly (the sensor is in `pairedList` and `GetHeart()` answers the BPM).

## `HookVoid`/`HookBool`/`HookVoidString`, and why they take a handler from outside

The OpenBikeControl handlers need the helper connection, which lives in
`../bleshim`'s `Windows.dll` — and the helper serves one client, so this
assembly cannot open a second. Hence a hook that takes an `Action`: `Loader.cs`
passes `OpenBike`'s methods by reflection, after `Install()`. Each refuses an
export whose metadata is not exactly its shape — the delegate has to marshal
as the original did: a `bool` return as the default 4-byte BOOL, a string as
the `LPStr` the metadata declares — and none calls the original: behind the
Bonjour gate the OBC ones are no-ops (and before `OBC_Initialize` would
dereference a null manager), and the other two are the problem. `OBC_StopScan` is hooked first, and
`OBC_StartScan` only if that worked: a scan the game cannot stop would be worse
than none.

## Two details that are deliberate

**Nothing may escape.** These run as native-to-managed thunks, where an
exception is a crash and not an error. Every call is wrapped: on failure the
shim writes a null pointer, returns 0, and logs.

**The delegates are rooted.** `GetFunctionPointerForDelegate` does not keep the
delegate alive; a collected one leaves the slot pointing at freed trampoline
code, which would fail minutes later and look like anything but this.

## Who owns the memory

Blocks are freshly allocated per call and never freed by us, exactly as the
CLR's out-marshalling does — whoever calls owns them. Measured over a multi-
minute run: several hundred polls, as many distinct addresses, not one reused.
A freed 64-byte block would come straight back from the allocator, so MyWhoosh
does not free them. That is a leak it has on Windows too, where the CLR
allocates the same way, and not one this adds: at the observed 2 Hz and ~400
bytes a poll, a few megabytes an hour. Reusing one buffer per export would
remove even that, but only by betting on the game never freeing — and if the bet
is wrong it is a use-after-free rather than a slow leak, so it is not taken.

The struct layout is mono's own: `Marshal.SizeOf` reports 64 bytes for
`DeviceInformationStruct` under wine-mono (two enums, six `LPWStr`, six `bool`
as `I1`, padded), and the game confirmed it by reading a device name and UUID
back out of our block and connecting to it.

## How it is started

`../bleshim/src/Loader.cs` calls `Install()` from a static constructor of the
assembly the game loads for Bluetooth, which runs inside the game's process,
on the game's thread, after `WindowsConnectivity.dll` is loaded and before the
first device-list poll — every condition `Install()` needs, and no native code
anywhere.

`Install` is a static void with no arguments, which is deliberate: it is the one
shape that needs nothing marshalled, so it stays callable from anywhere,
including through libmono's embedding API if a future loader ever has to.
`MYWHOOSH_SHIM_DLL` overrides the path it is loaded from; set empty, it disables
the shim, which is how the original failure is reproduced.
