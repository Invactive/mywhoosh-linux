# bleshim — real Bluetooth sensors for MyWhoosh under Wine

MyWhoosh is a Windows indoor-cycling game. It talks to smart trainers and
heart-rate straps over Bluetooth Low Energy, using a Windows API (WinRT) that
does not work under Wine. So on Linux the game finds no sensors, and the usual
workaround is to bridge them from a phone.

This directory makes the game's **own** Bluetooth path work, against your
computer's **own** Bluetooth adapter, through BlueZ — the Linux Bluetooth stack.
No phone, no LAN, no pretending. Your trainer pairs in the game's normal device
screen and streams power and cadence; a heart-rate strap pairs beside it.

It also gives the game back **OpenBikeControl**: virtual shifting from
[BikeControl](https://bikecontrol.app) and other OpenBikeControl controllers
over Wi-Fi, with the gears shown in MyWhoosh's own UI. On Windows that needs
Apple Bonjour, which does not work under Wine; here the host's avahi-daemon
finds the device instead.

**Installing it** takes one command and is described in the
[top-level README](../README.md): the Lutris installer puts all of this in place
and starts the helper alongside the game. The rest of this file is for working
on the code.

## Quick start (by hand)

On a fresh machine, use the Lutris installer instead — it does all of this and
wires the helper to the game. This is the development loop.

You need Python 3 with `dbus-python` and `PyGObject`, a working BlueZ (if
`bluetoothctl scan on` shows your trainer, you are fine), Mono's `mcs` compiler
to build, and a Wine prefix with MyWhoosh already installed.

```sh
./build.sh                                   # two .NET assemblies into build/
WINEPREFIX=<prefix> ./install.sh             # copy them into the prefix
WINEPREFIX=<prefix> ../exportshim/install.sh # and this one, see below
WINEPREFIX=<prefix> ./install.sh --verify    # ... and check what a prefix has
./run.sh                                     # start the helper + the game
```

`run.sh` launches `blehelper.py` and then the game, and points both at one log
file. Watch it:

```sh
tail -f /tmp/bleshim-*.log
```

A healthy start looks like this, and the last two lines only appear once you
open the game's sensor screen and wake the trainer up (pedal a turn):

```
[blehelper] listening on 127.0.0.1:27019
[bleshim]   export shim: invoking Install from C:\windows\mono\mono-2.0\lib\MyWhooshShim.dll
[exportshim] hooked 4/4 exports
[bleshim]   connected to blehelper on 127.0.0.1:27019
[blehelper] scanning
[bleshim]   connected to AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF (My Trainer)
[bleshim]   subscribed to 00002a63-… on AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
```

Before the game, you can check the Linux half on its own — this needs nothing
from Wine:

```sh
./blehelper.py --list                   # what is advertising right now
./blehelper.py --mdns                   # which OpenBikeControl apps answer on Wi-Fi
./blehelper.py                          # serve BlueZ on 127.0.0.1:27019
```

With BikeControl running and connected to your network, a healthy start also
shows, within a second of the game starting:

```
[exportshim] OBC_StopScan: slot … (void, handled by MyWhoosh.Ble.OpenBike.StopScan)
[exportshim] OBC_StartScan: slot … (void, handled by MyWhoosh.Ble.OpenBike.StartScan)
[bleshim]   obc: hooked after OBC_Initialize, … browsing until the game's OBC_StopScan
[blehelper] mdns: BikeControl at 192.168.1.19:36870 (BikeControl.local, wlp2s0)
[bleshim]   obc: handing BikeControl to the game: 192.168.1.19:36870 (BikeControl.local.)
```

and, once you answer "Yes" to the game's "OpenBikeControl instance was found
running" popup, `obc: the game is connected to BikeControl`.

## How it works

Three pieces, in the order the game meets them.

**1. A managed assembly the game loads instead of WinRT.** MyWhoosh's
`WindowsConnectivity.dll` references an assembly called `Windows`, which on
Windows is the WinRT metadata file. Mono resolves that reference *by simple
name*, and searches `MONO_PATH` first — the Lutris installer points that at
`$GAMEDIR/bleshim`. So a plain .NET assembly named `Windows.dll` sitting there
satisfies it, and the
game's calls — `BluetoothLEAdvertisementWatcher.Start`, `ReadValueAsync`,
`ValueChanged` — land in ordinary C# we wrote. That is `src/Windows.cs`, and it
is why no Wine change and no game-file edit is needed. (The game will not load
its own DLL if a single byte of it changed; see `../winmd/README.md`.)

**2. A Linux helper, `blehelper.py`.** Code inside the Wine prefix cannot talk
to BlueZ: BlueZ is D-Bus, D-Bus is a Unix socket, and Wine's winsock has no
`AF_UNIX`. So the hardware half lives outside Wine as a small Python program
speaking BlueZ's D-Bus API, and the two halves exchange one JSON object per line
over `127.0.0.1:27019`. `src/Backend.cs` is the only file in the shim that knows
this; everything above it just calls methods.

**3. The export shim, `../exportshim/`.** Four of the game's C entry points hand
their device list back by reference, and wine-mono refuses to marshal that
shape — the game's first device-list poll would be a fatal exception. The export
shim replaces those four function pointers in memory with managed
implementations. `src/Loader.cs` starts it from a static constructor, so it is
in place before the game's first poll.

**4. OpenBikeControl discovery.** The game finds OpenBikeControl devices by
browsing for them with Apple Bonjour — and only when a Bonjour service is
running, which under Wine is the one thing that must not be (below). With none,
its discovery quietly does nothing. So the export shim also points the game's
`OBC_StartScan`/`OBC_StopScan` at `src/OpenBike.cs`, the helper browses
`_openbikecontrol._tcp` with avahi-daemon, and each device found is handed to
the game exactly the way Bonjour's answer would have been. The game then
connects to it and speaks the protocol itself. If you miss its "connect?"
popup, it is shown again every 30 s until the game is connected
(`MYWHOOSH_OBC_REOFFER`, `0` to turn that off; `MYWHOOSH_OBC=0` turns the whole
thing off).

```

```

## What else the prefix needs

- **wine-mono**, from the runner or installed into the prefix — the Lutris
  install works with either, through `MONO_PATH`. `install.sh` below writes
  into the prefix's own tree, so it needs the second: a prefix whose runner
  keeps wine-mono in its own directory has no tree to write to. The stock build
  is fine; nothing here needs a patched runtime.

And one thing the prefix must **not** have:

- **A running `"Bonjour Service"`.** The game only touches Apple Bonjour's COM
  objects when the SCM reports a service by exactly that name in state
  `Running`; `OpenBikeManager::OBM_Initialize` and `WahooProgram::.ctor` both
  test it first and skip their initialisers when it is false. With no such
  service the Bonjour path is never entered, and nothing here needs a COM server
  at all. With one, the game demands Apple's COM objects and dies out of
  `OBM_Initialize` — a `COMException` if they are missing, a
  `NotImplementedException` from wine-mono's `ComAwareEventInfo` if they are
  there — before Bluetooth is ever reached. Installing Bonjour to get
  OpenBikeControl is exactly this; point 4 above does it without.

  A fresh prefix has no such service. One that has had Apple's Bonjour or
  iTunes installed into it does. `./install.sh --verify` says which state a
  prefix is in; `CLAUDE.md` has the IL.

## When it does not work

| What you see | What it usually is |
|---|---|
| Nothing at all in the log | The helper is not running, or the game is not reaching the sensor screen |
| `scanning` but your trainer never appears | It is asleep. Pedal. Confirm with `./blehelper.py --list` |
| `advertises no service UUIDs; the game will ignore it` | Normal for phones and watches. The game only shows devices advertising a fitness service |
| The game reports Bluetooth off | The helper is not reachable, or the adapter is off (`bluetoothctl power on`) |
| Game exits at startup with `COMException` | A `"Bonjour Service"` is running in the prefix, so the game took the Bonjour path. `./install.sh --verify` |
| The device list crashes on first poll | `../exportshim/` is not installed |
| The game freezes for ~20 s, again and again | An old build: a connect to a sleeping trainer ran on the game's thread. Update; `MYWHOOSH_BLE_INLINE_CONNECT=1` brings the old behaviour back |
| BikeControl is never offered | `./blehelper.py --mdns` must list it: same network, BikeControl's network (mDNS) connection on, avahi-daemon running. Then look for `obc:` lines in the log |
| The "connect?" popup vanished before you could answer | Wait — it comes back within 30 s — or tap the OpenBikeControl icon on the game's connection screen |
| The game crashes at startup in `OBM_Initialize` (`NotImplementedException`) | Bonjour is installed and running in the prefix; OpenBikeControl does not need it here. `./install.sh --verify` |
| Lutris is a Flatpak and there is no adapter | The sandbox cannot reach BlueZ; the helper is run on the host instead, and the host needs `dbus-python` and `PyGObject`. `../lutris/README.md` has the detail |

The log is the diagnostic tool. Every layer writes to it with its own tag —
`[blehelper]`, `[bleshim]`, `[exportshim]` — so you can see how far a request
got.

## Files

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `src/Windows.cs` | The WinRT surface the game calls: watcher, device, GATT service and characteristic, `Radio`, `DataReader`/`DataWriter` |
| `src/Backend.cs` | The only thing that knows about the helper: connection, request/response, event dispatch, logging |
| `src/Json.cs` | A small JSON reader/writer, because wine-mono's framework has none |
| `src/Loader.cs` | Starts `../exportshim/` from inside the game, and hooks the OpenBikeControl exports |
| `src/OpenBike.cs` | OpenBikeControl discovery without Bonjour: browse through the helper, hand each device to the game's own callback |
| `src/SystemRuntimeWindowsRuntime.cs` | The one member the game needs to `await` a WinRT call |
| `blehelper.py` | The Linux half: BlueZ and avahi over D-Bus, serving one client on loopback |
| `TestBle.cs` | Drives the shim the way the game does, without the game |
| `TestObc.cs` | The same for OpenBikeControl: discovery, the game's callback, a TCP session to the phone |
| `build.sh` / `install.sh` / `run.sh` | Build, install into a prefix, launch |

`install.sh --verify` says what is currently in a prefix — the in-prefix tree or
the Lutris layout's `bleshim/`, the Bonjour gate, and each piece OpenBikeControl
needs, ending with what answers on the network right now; `--restore` puts the
inert stubs from `../winmd/` back, which turns Bluetooth off again without
breaking the game.

While working on the shim, `TestBle.cs` is a much faster loop than launching the
game:

```sh
mcs -out:build/TestBle.exe -r:build/Windows.dll TestBle.cs
mono build/TestBle.exe                                # radios, then a 10s scan
mono build/TestBle.exe AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF              # connect, walk GATT, subscribe
mono build/TestBle.exe AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF --control    # ... and take FTMS control
```

Run it under wine-mono as well as the host's Mono — the two runtimes disagree
about details that only bite inside the prefix. `CLAUDE.md` explains which.

`TestObc.cs` does the same for OpenBikeControl, and only means something under
wine-mono. Close the game first (BikeControl serves one client), and copy the
game's `WindowsConnectivity.dll` next to it — a copy; the game's own must stay
untouched:

```sh
./blehelper.py --port 27020 &
cp <game>/WindowsConnectivity.dll build/
mcs -platform:x64 -out:build/TestObc.exe TestObc.cs src/OpenBike.cs src/Backend.cs src/Json.cs
MYWHOOSH_BLE_PORT=27020 wine build/TestObc.exe --seconds 30     # press buttons in the app
MYWHOOSH_BLE_PORT=27020 MYWHOOSH_OBC_REOFFER=5 wine build/TestObc.exe --watch 30
```

No Mono on the host? `build.sh` falls back to the `mcs.exe` inside a Proton's
wine-mono, run in a scratch prefix of its own (`../tools/mcs.sh`); in a shell,
`. ../tools/mcs.sh` gives you the same `mcs`.

## Going deeper

`CLAUDE.md` in this directory is the engineering reference: what the game's own
IL requires, the traps in wine-mono that cost the most time, why the design is
shaped this way, and what is still open.
