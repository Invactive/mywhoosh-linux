# bleshim — engineering notes

Reference for changing this code. `README.md` is the orientation; this is the
part that is expensive to rediscover.

## The constraint everything obeys

MyWhoosh hashes `WindowsConnectivity.dll` and silently declines to load it if a
single byte differs — including bytes in the DOS stub, which mean nothing to any
loader. The game then carries on to the UI as if the DLL were not there. So no
approach that edits a game file is available, and none is used: everything here
is either a file we add to the prefix, or memory we write inside our own
process. `../winmd/README.md` has the measurements.

## Why this design and not another

**Wine's own Bluetooth stack is not reachable from here, twice over.**

Mono has no WinRT projection at all — no `RoGetActivationFactory`, no WinMD type
resolution, no runtime-callable wrapper for `IAsyncOperation`. So even a
finished `windows.devices.bluetooth` in Wine would be invisible to the game's
managed code. That fact is what makes "substitute a managed assembly" the
approach rather than one option among several.

Wine's Win32 GATT API is real but incomplete, measured by inspecting the shipped
binaries:

| | wine 10.0 | wine 11.0 |
|---|---|---|
| `winebth.so` knows `org.bluez.GattCharacteristic1` | no | yes |
| Device discovery (`StartDiscovery`) | no | yes |
| Read a characteristic | no | no |
| Write a characteristic | no | no |
| Notifications | no | no |
| Advertisement scanning | no | no |

Upstream is slightly ahead — `BluetoothGATTGetCharacteristicValue` (read) landed
in early 2026 — but `BluetoothGATTSetCharacteristicValue` and
`BluetoothGATTRegisterEvent` are still `@ stub`, and there is no advertisement
watcher. Write and notify are how a trainer takes ERG commands and reports
power; scanning is how it is found at all.

This is why `src/Backend.cs` is the *only* file that knows how hardware is
reached. If Wine's stack catches up, or if someone contributes to it, the
backend moves and nothing above it changes.

## What the game actually calls

Read out of the game's IL with `../tools/ildump.sh`, not from WinRT
documentation. `../winmd/members.py` reports 34 types and 61 members
referenced, with their signatures; most are plumbing (`DataReader`, `IBuffer`
and `CryptographicBuffer` are `byte[]` wrappers, `IAsyncOperation<T>` is a
`Task<T>`). The real surface is about fifteen operations, each one BlueZ call
wide:

| The game calls | BlueZ |
|---|---|
| `BluetoothLEAdvertisementWatcher.Start` / `Stop` | `Adapter1.StartDiscovery` (`Transport=le`, `DuplicateData=true`) |
| `…Received` → `BluetoothAddress`, `Advertisement.LocalName` / `.ServiceUuids` | `Device1` `Address` / `Name` / `UUIDs` / `RSSI`, via `InterfacesAdded` + `PropertiesChanged` |
| `BluetoothLEDevice.FromBluetoothAddressAsync(ulong)` | uint64 ↔ MAC, then the `Device1` object |
| `get_Name`, `get_ConnectionStatus`, `ConnectionStatusChanged` | `Device1.Name` / `.Connected` + `PropertiesChanged` |
| `GetGattServicesAsync` | `Device1.Connect()`, wait for `ServicesResolved`, enumerate `GattService1` |
| `GetCharacteristicsAsync`, `get_Uuid`, `get_CharacteristicProperties` | `GattCharacteristic1` `UUID` + `Flags` |
| `ReadValueAsync` | `ReadValue` |
| `WriteValueAsync` / `WriteValueWithResultAsync` | `WriteValue`, `type=command` / `type=request` |
| `WriteClientCharacteristicConfigurationDescriptorAsync`, `ValueChanged` | `StartNotify` + `PropertiesChanged` on `Value` |
| `Radio.GetRadiosAsync` | `Adapter1.Powered` |

Three behaviours in the game's IL that are easy to get wrong:

- **An advertisement with no service UUIDs is discarded.**
  `BluetoothProgram::Advertisement_Received` returns immediately when
  `args.Advertisement.ServiceUuids` is empty, and otherwise classifies the
  device by comparing them against `GattServiceUuids.CyclingPower` (`1818`),
  `CyclingSpeedAndCadence` (`1816`), `HeartRate` (`180d`),
  `RunningSpeedAndCadence` (`1814`), FTMS
  (`00001826-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`) and Wahoo's
  `ce060000-43e5-11e4-916c-0800200c9a66`. A scan reporting names and addresses
  but no UUIDs produces an empty list in the game and nothing in any log to say
  why.
- **A missing name is fine.** With an empty `LocalName` the game builds a
  placeholder from the address (`GenerateTempName`, `"X12"`-formatted). The shim
  must not invent one.
- **The game fills its own slots.** `BluetoothProgram::GetAllScannedDevices`
  offers a sensor for the controllable, cadence and heart-rate slots according
  to `SensorBase::features` (`hasControllable`, `hasCadence`, `hasHeart`), which
  it derives after connecting. Nothing in the shim needs to filter by slot, and
  nothing here should start: each sensor is its own device with its own
  connection.

## wine-mono traps

Each of these cost real time. They share a shape: the code is correct on the
host and wrong in the prefix, or wrong only at runtime.

**Signatures must match the game's metadata exactly, not just by name.**
`BluetoothLEAdvertisement.ServiceUuids` returning `IReadOnlyList<Guid>` compiles
and then throws `MissingMethodException` on every advertisement — the game's
metadata says `IList<Guid>`, because WinRT's `IVector<T>` projects as
`IList<T>`. The failure surfaces inside the game's event handler with no device
ever appearing, which looks exactly like "the scan found nothing".

`members.py --check` decodes both sides' signature blobs and compares them, so
this one is caught at build time rather than in a ride. Run it after every
change to `src/Windows.cs`:

```sh
../winmd/members.py <prefix>/…/WindowsConnectivity.dll --check --build-dir build
```

**BCL types live in different assemblies than on the host.**
`System.Collections.Generic.Queue<T>` is in `System.dll` on wine-mono's
framework and in `mscorlib` on the host Mono. An assembly built against the
wrong one loads fine outside Wine and throws `TypeLoadException` in the prefix.
`Backend.Events` is a `List<BackendEvent>` used as a FIFO for that reason. This
is why `TestBle.exe` must be run under *both* runtimes before believing a
change.

**There is no JSON in the framework**, hence `src/Json.cs`.

**Unix paths are not paths.** wine-mono reads `/tmp/x` as `C:\tmp\x`, which does
not exist, so `MYWHOOSH_SHIM_LOG=/tmp/…` silently logged nothing at all — the
one moment the log mattered. `Backend.OpenLog` now tries `Z:\tmp\…` first (`Z:`
is Wine's mapping of the Linux root) and falls back to stderr rather than going
quiet.

**Nothing may escape into a native-to-managed thunk.** The game calls this code
through mono wrappers where an escaping exception is a process crash, not a
caught error. Every entry point catches. `Loader.Kick()` in particular is called
from static constructors, where a throw would take the whole type — and with it
the BLE path — down.

## Rules inside the shim

**Every `IAsyncOperation` completes inline — except the connect.**
`BluetoothProgram::IsBluetoothEnabled` calls `CheckRadioState()` and then
`Task.Wait()`s on it, on the game's thread, so the radio query must already be
finished when it is handed back; `src/Windows.cs` wraps `Task.FromResult`.

`BluetoothLEDevice.FromBluetoothAddressAsync` is the exception, and it has to
be. It is where the helper connects, which takes up to 20 s for a trainer that
is asleep (`ADVERT_TIMEOUT`), and the game calls it from its own thread: the
auto-connect after a profile is chosen (`AutoConnectFunc` → `BluetoothSensor::Connect`)
and the pairing screen (`ConnectDevice` → `PairDevice`). Both go through
`ExtensionMethods::Await`, which is `async void` — on Windows the call returns
at once and the rest runs on WinRT's threads. Completed inline, it froze the
game for the whole wait, every ~25 s while the saved trainer slept; fullscreen,
that looks like the whole desktop hanging. The IL settles that deferring it is
safe: all eight WinRT call sites in `WindowsConnectivity.dll` are consumed by
`await` through `WindowsRuntimeSystemExtensions::GetAwaiter`, and the radio
check is the only `Task.Wait` in the assembly. So the connect runs on a pool
thread and the game's connect sequence continues there, as on Windows.
`MYWHOOSH_BLE_INLINE_CONNECT=1` restores the old behaviour.

**The game's thread never waits long for the helper.** The helper is
single-threaded, so while it connects, everything else queues behind it —
including the radio query (`BT_GetModuleState` → `IsBluetoothEnabled`) and scan
start/stop, which come from the game's thread. `Backend.CallWithin` bounds the
wait (`GameThreadTimeoutMs`, and zero while another request is outstanding);
the request still goes out and is still carried out, in order. Radios answer
from the last reply meanwhile — never empty, which the game reads as
"Bluetooth off" — and a scan that merely timed out is not reported as stopped
(`Backend.LastCallTimedOut`).

**Events arrive on the shim's dispatcher thread**, which is not a thread the
game created. This was the risk named before any of it was written and it turns
out to be fine in practice, but it is the kind of thing that surfaces as a hang
rather than an exception, so it is worth remembering when one appears.

## The helper protocol

Newline-delimited JSON on `127.0.0.1:27019`, one client at a time.

- Requests carry `id` and `op`: `radios`, `scan`, `connect`, `disconnect`,
  `services`, `chars`, `read`, `write`, `notify`, and for OpenBikeControl
  `mdns_browse` (`type`, `enable`) and `tcp_peer` (`ip`, `port` → `connected`).
  Replies carry the same `id`.
- Unsolicited events carry `ev`: `advert`, `value`, `connection`, `mdns`
  (`type`, `name`, `host`, `ip`, `port`, `iface`, `txt`) and `mdns_lost`.
- The helper serves requests in order, and answers a `connect` when it is done:
  waiting for a sleeping trainer's advertisement (`ADVERT_TIMEOUT`, 20 s) and
  BlueZ's `Connect()` run as main-loop callbacks, not nested loops, so every
  other request is answered meanwhile. It used to block — and while a saved
  trainer sleeps the game retries every ~25 s, so the helper was busy most of
  the time, and the OpenBikeControl icon's re-browse waited 20 s behind it.
  Scan state survives overlapping waits: `Bluez.wanted` (the client's) and
  `Bluez.waiters` (connects that started a scan) decide when it stops.
- The shim connects lazily and retries every 5 s, so starting the helper after
  the game still works.

Deliberately dumb and transport-agnostic: the helper can later move in-process,
or be replaced by Wine's own API, without `src/Windows.cs` noticing.

## The Bonjour gate

This stack needs no Bonjour COM server and no patched wine-mono, and the reason
is one branch in the game's own IL rather than anything the shim does.

`OpenBikeManager::GetNetworkState` and `WahooProgram::GetNetworkState` are the
same method twice: walk `ServiceController.GetServices()`, look for a service
named exactly `"Bonjour Service"`, return true only if its `Status` is `4`
(`Running`). Each constructor stores that in `isBonjourEnabled`, and the two
places that touch COM branch over themselves when it is false:

```
OpenBikeManager::OBM_Initialize   IL_0001 ldfld isBonjourEnabled
                                  IL_0006 brfalse IL_0100      <- the ret
WahooProgram::.ctor               IL_0063 ldfld isBonjourEnabled
                                  IL_0068 brfalse.s IL_0070    <- past WFTNP_Init
```

Those two are the whole of it. Across all 126 types in
`WindowsConnectivity.dll` there are exactly four `Marshal::GetTypeFromCLSID`
call sites and twelve `ComAwareEventInfo::.ctor` sites, and every one of them is
inside `OBM_Initialize`, `WFTNP_Init` or `WFTNP_Dispose` — all three behind the
gate. Nothing else in the assembly reaches Bonjour at all.

So with no `"Bonjour Service"` running:

- `CoCreateInstance` is never called, so the `COMException` out of
  `OBM_Initialize` cannot happen and no COM server has to exist;
- `ComAwareEventInfo` is never constructed, so it does not matter that wine-mono
  leaves all of it as `NotImplementedException`;
- `WD_GetDirconServiceAvailability` returns false and the game simply does not
  offer Direct Connect, which here is correct;
- `OBM_Initialize`/`OBM_StartScan` do nothing, so the game would find no
  OpenBikeControl devices — which is why the next section exists. It keeps
  the gate shut and does the discovery itself.

A fresh prefix has no such service, so this costs nothing. A prefix that has had
Apple's Bonjour installed into it — by iTunes, or deliberately — makes the
Bluetooth path appear to require a COM server and a patched runtime, and that
appearance is entirely an artefact of the service. `./install.sh --verify`
reports the gate state; the service is not ours and the script never removes it.

## OpenBikeControl, without Bonjour

OpenBikeControl is how BikeControl (and a KICKR BIKE PRO, and others) send
virtual shifts to the game over Wi-Fi: the device advertises
`_openbikecontrol._tcp` over mDNS, the app connects over TCP and reads button
messages. Spec: [openbikecontrol-protocol](https://github.com/OpenBikeControl/openbikecontrol-protocol)
(`MDNS.md`, `PROTOCOL.md`).

**What the IL says lives where.** Only discovery is in `WindowsConnectivity.dll`:

| | |
|---|---|
| `OBC_Initialize(OpenBikeDataDelegate)` | `new OpenBikeManager` (constructor: the gate check), `OBM_Initialize`, store the delegate in `DelegateCallbacks.OpenBikeDataCallback` |
| `OBC_StartScan` / `OBC_StopScan` | `OBM_StartScan`: a fresh Bonjour `Browse("_openbikecontrol._tcp.")` *on every call* / `browser.Stop()` |
| `ServiceFound` | `Resolve(...)` |
| `ServiceResolved` | `Dns.GetHostAddressesAsync(hostname)`, first `InterNetwork` address whose text is ≥ 5 characters, `FOpenBikeDataStruct{ipAddress, hostName, port}`, `OpenBikeDataCallback.Invoke` |
| `ServiceLost` | `ret` — the game is never told |
| `OperationFailed` | `throw new NotImplementedException()` |

The TCP connection and the protocol are the engine's: `MyWhoosh-Win64-Shipping.exe`
has `UOpenBikeController::ConnectToOpenBike`, `OnOpenBikeMessageReceived`,
`CheckOpenBikeSocketConnection`, `EVirtualGears::E_Gear1..30` and the popup text
"OpenBikeControl instance was found running. Would you like to connect to the
instance?". It uses Winsock, which works under Wine unchanged. So the shim
needs no TCP client and no protocol code — a second client would only compete
with the engine's, and BikeControl serves one.

**The marshalling shape**, measured under wine-mono: `OpenBikeDataDelegate` is
`void(FOpenBikeDataStruct)`, by value, no `UnmanagedFunctionPointer`; the struct
is `Sequential, CharSet=Unicode`, 24 bytes — `LPWStr ipAddress @0`,
`int port @8`, `LPWStr hostName @16`. `hostName` comes from argument 5 of the
Bonjour handler (the SRV target, a BSTR with the trailing dot), `port` from
argument 6 (`ushort`). Managed-to-native, struct by value with strings: the same
shape as `ConnectDelegate`, which the Bluetooth path already uses.

**What replaces Bonjour.** `../exportshim` points the two `void()` exports
`OBC_StartScan` / `OBC_StopScan` at `src/OpenBike.cs` (`ExportShim.HookVoid`,
wired from `src/Loader.cs`). `OBC_Initialize` is left alone: with the gate shut
it does nothing but store the delegate, which is what is needed.
`blehelper.py` browses with avahi-daemon — on the Linux side, because avahi
already owns UDP 5353 there — and follows each service with a persistent
`ServiceResolver`, so a phone that changes address, or an app that comes back
on another port (BikeControl walks to the next free one: 36868, 36870, …), is
reported again. `OpenBike.cs` fills the game's own struct by reflection,
exactly as `ServiceResolved` does, and calls the game's own delegate object —
so mono marshals it through the same wrapper. On its own thread: the original
runs on Bonjour's event thread, and the engine's callback must not be able to
hold up the trainer's notifications.

**Things measured in the game:**

- The game calls `OBC_Initialize` and `OBC_StartScan` at startup, *before*
  `Loader.Kick` has hooked anything, and never calls `OBC_StopScan` in a normal
  session. `OpenBike.Hooked` therefore starts browsing when it finds the
  delegate already set.
- The engine connects to `ipAddress`; nothing was seen resolving `hostName`.
- The engine's popup times out within seconds, and the first offer lands among
  the game's own startup popups, so it is easy to miss. This is the one
  deliberate departure from the original: while the game has no TCP connection
  to a service, it is offered again every `MYWHOOSH_OBC_REOFFER` seconds
  (default 30, `0` = never), at most 20 times in a row. The helper's `tcp_peer`
  reads the engine's socket out of `/proc/net/tcp` — Winsock under Wine is a
  plain Linux socket. A repeated `OBC_StartScan` (the OpenBikeControl icon on
  the connection screen) offers everything again, as a fresh Bonjour browse
  would — from `OpenBike.Known`, the shim's own record of what the helper has
  reported, so the popup comes at once; the browse that follows confirms it.

- The connection screen's OpenBikeControl icon first asks
  `WD_GetDirconServiceAvailability` — `WahooProgram::GetBonjourService`, "is a
  service named Bonjour Service installed" — and on "no" shows *Dircon Service
  Unavailable … proceed with installation?* instead of scanning. YES calls
  `WD_InstallDirconServiceAsync`: `netsh advfirewall set allprofile state off`
  and the bundled `Content/Libraries/Win64/Dircon/bonjoursdksetup.exe` — which
  is how a prefix comes to have Bonjour, and with it the startup crash. So
  availability answers yes (safe: every Bonjour COM path checks
  `isBonjourEnabled`, read once at startup from the *running* service, never
  this) and the install is refused and logged, always, even with
  `MYWHOOSH_OBC=0`.

`MYWHOOSH_OBC=0` leaves the OBC exports and the availability query alone. `TestObc.cs` drives the
whole path without the game, under wine-mono: discovery, the delegate through
a native function pointer read back at the engine's offsets, and a TCP session
decoding the device's messages.

## Open

**OpenBikeControl under Flatpak is unridden.** The helper already runs on the
host there, and avahi is on the host's system bus, so it should hold; `tcp_peer`
assumes the game shares the host's network namespace, which Flatpak's
`--share=network` gives.

**Only the pieces have been verified on a clean install, not the whole.** The
Lutris installer's file steps were dry-run through Lutris' own `CommandsMixin`
against a scratch prefix, and the session script exercised for
start/stop/already-running/missing-helper. What has not been done is `lutris -i`
on a machine with no prefix, all the way to a ride. Two things only that shows:

- that `MONO_PATH` reaches the game through Lutris for every runner people
  actually use. It is how the installer finds the shim now, because current
  runners (GE-Proton, wine-ge 8) put no wine-mono tree in the prefix at all
  (issue #9). Measured with a probe assembly under GE-Proton10-4's wine: found
  on the runner's shared mono, and ahead of a copy in an in-prefix tree; a Unix
  path is read as `C:\...` and finds nothing. The game itself has not been
  launched that way through Lutris. `mywhoosh-ble.sh start` warns when neither
  `MONO_PATH` nor a real in-prefix tree would find it;
- whether the game, freshly installed and never patched, reaches the sensor
  screen.

**The Flatpak path is reasoned, not ridden.** Flatpak Lutris gets no
`--socket=system-bus` and no `--system-talk-name=org.bluez`, so
`../lutris/mywhoosh-ble.sh` routes the probes and the helper through
`flatpak-spawn --host` when `/.flatpak-info` exists, and starts the helper with
`--watch-bus` so killing the `flatpak-spawn` in the pidfile takes the host
process with it. That was exercised against a stand-in `flatpak-spawn`, which
proves the plumbing and the argument quoting but not the two things only a real
sandbox shows: whether `--watch-bus` really reaps the helper on `stop`, and
whether the portal's idea of the game directory matches the sandbox's.

**Users install a release, not this tree.** `../dist.sh` builds `src/` and
`../exportshim/`, packs them with `blehelper.py` and `../lutris/mywhoosh-ble.sh`
into one archive, and `--release <tag>` publishes it; the installers fetch that
tag. So a change here reaches nobody until a release is cut, and the helper can
never be a different build from the shim it talks to over loopback. `MANIFEST`,
inside the archive and left in the prefix, records the commit each build came
from, which is the only way to tell afterwards what a prefix has.
