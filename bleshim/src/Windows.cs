// The `Windows` assembly MyWhoosh's WindowsConnectivity.dll references, with
// the answers made true.
//
// The game's BT_* stack is written against WinRT: BluetoothLEAdvertisementWatcher
// to scan, BluetoothLEDevice and the Gatt* family to connect and exchange data.
// Wine has no WinRT, and mono has no WinRT projection, so on the face of it that
// path is closed under Wine.  It is not, because of how mono resolves the
// reference: `Windows, Version=255.255.255.255` is looked up by *simple name*
// in the prefix's own mono tree, and an ordinary managed assembly with that name
// satisfies it.  The game then calls these members through ordinary IL call
// sites and cannot tell what is behind them.
//
// ../../winmd/ is that assembly with every member answering "no radio, no
// devices, no services" -- which is what keeps the game alive today.  This is
// the same surface (the same 34 types and 60 members ../../winmd/members.py
// reads out of the game's metadata) with the answers coming from real hardware
// through Backend.cs.
//
// Three things the game does that the shape of this file follows, all read out
// of its IL with ../../tools/ildump.sh rather than assumed:
//
//   * BluetoothProgram::Advertisement_Received returns immediately unless
//     Advertisement.ServiceUuids is non-empty, and classifies the device by
//     comparing those UUIDs against CyclingPower, CyclingSpeedAndCadence,
//     HeartRate, RunningSpeedAndCadence, FTMS (0x1826) and Wahoo's private
//     service.  An advertisement reported without service UUIDs is silently
//     dropped, so the helper reports what BlueZ knows and this passes it on
//     unfiltered.
//   * An empty LocalName is expected: the game builds a placeholder name from
//     the address itself (GenerateTempName).  So a nameless device is reported
//     nameless rather than given something invented here.
//   * The game fills its own pairing slots from SensorBase::features after
//     connecting, so nothing here decides what a sensor is good for.
//
// Everything returns rather than throws.  These run under mono's
// native-to-managed wrappers on the way back into the game, where an escaping
// exception is a crash and not an error; a failed call reports the WinRT
// failure value (null, Unreachable, an empty list) exactly as it would on
// Windows with the device switched off.
//
// The static constructors of the types the game touches first also start
// ../../exportshim -- see Loader.cs, which explains why that job landed here.
//
// One deliberate simplification: every operation completes on the calling
// thread and the IAsyncOperation it returns is already finished.  The game
// awaits these, and at least one caller (BluetoothProgram::IsBluetoothEnabled)
// awaits and then blocks the same thread on Task.Wait() -- which deadlocks the
// moment a continuation has to be posted back to a thread that is busy waiting.
// Completing inline cannot deadlock.  The cost is that a slow call blocks its
// caller, which is why connect is bounded on the helper's side rather than
// here.
