// The one place that knows how this shim reaches real hardware.
//
// Everything above here is Windows.cs answering the game's WinRT calls; below
// here is Linux.  The two are separated on purpose, because the way across is
// expected to change: Wine's own Bluetooth stack (winebth.sys, BlueZ-backed)
// already enumerates GATT services and characteristics, and when it grows
// characteristic writes, notifications and advertisement scanning this file is
// the only one that has to be rewritten to use it.  Today it cannot -- see
// ../CLAUDE.md for which parts of that stack are still missing.
//
// Why a helper process at all.  BlueZ is reached over D-Bus, D-Bus is a unix
// socket, and Wine's winsock has no AF_UNIX: the constant is in winsock.h and
// nothing implements it.  Managed code inside the prefix therefore cannot speak
// to BlueZ directly however it is written, so blehelper.py does it on the Linux
// side and this talks to it over loopback TCP -- one hop, newline-delimited
// JSON, and a protocol dumb enough that moving it in-process later changes
// nothing above this file.
//
// The helper is optional in the sense that nothing here throws when it is
// absent: the game then sees a machine with no Bluetooth devices, which is what
// it saw from the stubs in ../../winmd and survived.
